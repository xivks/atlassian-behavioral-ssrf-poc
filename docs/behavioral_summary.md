## Objective
Document non-intrusive behavioral testing on Atlassian Cloud to observe webhook interactions, redirect preservation, and security policy behavior in controlled environments.

---

## Test Environment
- Target: `bugbounty-test-xivks.atlassian.net`
- Tools: Burp Suite, curl, Firefox Developer Edition
- Systems: Windows 11 (Local), Virtual environment for analysis
- Test type: Outbound request observation and behavior validation

---

## Behavioral Observations
| Probe | Response | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| `/rest/api/latest/` | 404 | Endpoint protected; no unintended exposure |
| `/s/` | 404 | Expected denial; no content leak |
| Redirect param test | 302 to login | Controlled redirect, parameter preserved |
| Webhook probe | 200 (HEAD/GET) | Confirms external fetch, no sensitive access |

---

## Ethical Commitment
All tests were conducted only on authorized instances, without accessing or attempting to access customer data or private systems.  
Results are anonymized and presented for validation and educational purposes.

---

## Next Steps
- Continue studying outbound fetch behavior in Atlassian Cloud.
- Apply learnings for iOS Private Cloud Compute testing (Apple SRD goal).
